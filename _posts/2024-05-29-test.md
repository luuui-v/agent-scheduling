Hi there, @evanelias :wave:



Welcome to the Netlify Forums :netliconfetti: this is a great question.



When folks create their first site on Netlify and we run the first build, we set a version for all of the major languages that match the default version installed on the build image at the time. This is then stored on the siteâ€™s repo object.



I believe that if you re-connect your repo, it will reset the versions for you. In order to try this, you can follow these steps:



For your selected site, go to Site settings > Build & deploy > Build settings , select Link to a different repository , and then select the same repository to re-link your site to it.



Let me know if this works!
